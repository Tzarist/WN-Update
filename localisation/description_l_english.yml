But after a falling out with his father, he strived to carve out his own destiny. Soon Hamlin would use connections he made through his law cilents to achieve a position as an assistent to the New England Secretary of Trade, Winston Churchill. Him and Churchill would boost a great friendship, one so much so that when Churchill would be appointed to become Prime Minister of New England, he appointed Hamlin in his former post. Hamlin's career as Secretary of Trade would see an even greater dominance of British corporate grip over the New Englandish economy. During this period, Hamlin would make great connections with several British CEO's and MP's which would garner Hamlin the reputation of being economically savy and a loyalist to the crown. After the collapse of the London Stock Exchange in 1931, the British government would sack many government officals but Hamlin was spared. This is where Hamlin would achieve his big break, he would be offered the position of Governor of the far away Crown Colony of Shanghai with the hopes that Hamlin could work some of his so called "economic magic" and turn the Orient's Crown City to an economic powerhouse once again that would benefit the British Empire. Hamlin would thus become Governor of Shanghai in 1935 but he wasn't prepared for the chaos that would be the far east. Hamlin quickly realized he was in a far awa land, and that Shanghai was far different then New England. He had a population that hated him, while also having to contend with the ever-changing political landscape of East Asia. So the question is will Hamlin use that same determination that led him to become Governor, or succumb to the chaotic city that is Shanghai?"

This is the question Robert Alexander finds himself confronted with every moment of his seemingly-cursed existence. A scoundrel to his Northern kinsmen who remember very vividly his role in stopping the rebellion. A traitor to his race for not bending to the whims of the Klan, an enemy of the black man for not doing enough to fight them. His only allies remain in the common folk, and even then, his grip is slipping. His undeniable military talents have done little to help mitigate these crises. The Great Depression seems unstoppable, and all his supposed allies continue to scheme and curse his name behind his back, whilst the murder of his predecessor looms overhead as it seems each subsequent attempt on his life grows closer to success. And amidst all of this, there is the struggle within. To stand firm in the face of the overwhelming obstacles ahead and keep his darker thoughts at bay proves a more difficult challenge with each passing day. Perhaps it would be best to let himself be cast out, be it by the ballot or the bullet. To let history wash him away, and for the people of the South to take a new direction.  But is that truly the fate he is destined for? He fought tooth and nail to keep the Spaniards and Yankee radicals at bay. Shrugged off attempts on his life and threats from all sides. He fought amongst men and commanded them. He whipped armies into shape in their bleakest moments, and had slain many who would harm his beloved South. Who is to say that he cannot do so once more? To overcome the storm within himself and his country?  This song-and-dance within himself cannot continue forever. The Elections of ‘38 are on the horizon, and turmoil is brewing at home and abroad. Prime Minister Alexander must determine how he shall act in the face of the changing times, lest history choose for him."
