He is a figurehead for the Italian Parliament after his father attempted to consolidate power around the Italian throne. Seen as a weak and incompetent leader there are worries that he will befall the same fate as his uncle Ferdinand II who was assassinated by an anarchist. In an increasingly radicalized Italy, the Sicilian monarchy seems to be on the way out. But with the backing of powerful oligarchs and Europe's monarchs, there may be hope on the horizon for Alfonso to restore the name of the Monarchy in the eyes of the Italian people by using the nationalistic drive of war to reclaim the loss Italian heartland of Turin from the vile French."
